This version the main project is led blink 2, where we added a custom Makefile
from scratch following

http://hackaday.com/2016/03/22/embed-with-elliot-arm-makefile-madness/

Did not follow his first makefile to the letter since compiling assembly was not known
and libnosys was also not known
https://gist.github.com/hexagon5un/48df2a236531d3ff01af

took a little help from his second makefile
